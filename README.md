##Medium Clone

#Purpose:
Medium clone is a mini-project that seeks to practice the core concepts I have studied in React.
This will incorporate other programming concepts and tools like TypeScript, databases, git and best practices.

Key Features:
Creating A Post:
A writer should be able to create a post by providing post title, body, background or descriptive image, name, profession and image.

Displaying Post:
A displayed post should contain the writer's name, profession and image. Again it should contain the post title and body, date posted and time read.
Initial post should be 10 and display less than 10 words of the body

Reading Post Content:
A user should be able to read the full post by clicking on the post content (anything in it). This view will consist of the post title, avatar, name, minutes of read, date, and the main body.
